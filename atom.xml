		<title>Lessons learned from the May 2021 online workshop</title>
		<published>2021-11-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-11-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/25/lessons-learned-may-2021/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;May 10-12 and 18-20, 2021, we gave our at that time largest &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;2021-05-10-workshop&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CodeRefinery
online workshop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (6 x 3.5 hours) with 128 participants.
We plan to deliver many more such workshops based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;&quot;&gt;lessons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we wish to share with the community our lessons learned: What worked well
and what we need and plan to improve. We use bullet point format for brevity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complements our lessons learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;first-online-workshop&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our first online workshop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-coordination&quot;&gt;Lesson coordination&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person teaching should not be doing the intro as well, as they may still need to set stuff up and it is better to focus on the lesson only.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The teaching coordinator should check in for basic practicalities with each instructor:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;team-teaching if desired&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;material to cover&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;schedule breaks&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test screenshare prior to the lesson&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to control breakouts yourself&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be clear about video on or off for instructors. If multiple people on then gallery OBS capture doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include role mentoring as part of the coordination initial meeting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More talk about &amp;quot;voice of audience&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare schedule summary for next day to be sent to everyone, together with instructors of following day, after workshop day: lessons to be covered and break&#x2F;exercise room timing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform individual exercise leads about how the set group of individual learners is like (e.g. expecting how many in the room, OS, background).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform exercise leads and all the team members who are replacing when a regular exercise leader is absent.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearer role distribution, spreading the work among many is a great idea but it things should be clearly (or as clearly as possible split) also for roles during workshop, one or few people should have &#x27;power&#x27; to decide things and clearly communicate: instead of &amp;quot;could somebody do X?&amp;quot; we have a person in charge of X.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zoom-and-obs&quot;&gt;Zoom and OBS&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask participants to join with video OFF when they join after the workshop started (otherwise they may appear in the stream).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge amount of work that many people did making the instructions, and testing them on all the different OSs, surely helped.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For some people the screenshare froze after break&#x2F; when screenshare switched between instructors, for browser reloading solved it, for client people had to rejoin chat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gallery insert view is risky.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&#x27;t spotlight someone when only two peoples&#x27; videos are on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can basically record the cutpoints and TOC while I am watching it, then there is very little effort to process afterwards. This probably requires one almost-dedicated person, but is worth it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes manual work to switch from one to two people (changing cropping), and also two to three (alignment).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gallery view for a lesson worked OK, but you must always expect people to join and appear. Stress level is high and we need to be vigilant to not let a problem go unnoticed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can switch from single-person to gallery live without too much trouble.
If spotlighting requires at least two videos but no &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; video is available or wouldn&#x27;t make sense, one workaround might be to have someone show a &amp;quot;video&amp;quot; (zoom background + webcam cover on) so that it only shows the background) of CR logo or schedule or whatever feels relevant.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If spotlighting requires at least two videos but no &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; video is available or wouldn&#x27;t make sense, one workaround might be to have someone show a &amp;quot;video&amp;quot; (zoom background + webcam cover on) so that it only shows the background) of CR logo or schedule or whatever feels relevant.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When capturing windows with OBS, set to &amp;quot;don&#x27;t capture mouse cursor&amp;quot; and then you can hover over and pin&#x2F;unpin video and the cursor and pop-up menu don&#x27;t appear in the capture.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is good when the presenters clearly say when things start and end, as in &amp;quot;And now we are done with the intro, and will go to our first lesson, Jupyter&amp;quot;. It makes cutting a bit easier and also helps learners to re-orient.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The zoom default &amp;quot;focus on the current speaker&amp;quot; view was quite good for co-teaching, it was slightly less fragile than full gallery view but still swapped between the two people (but someone speaking with video off would have their name or profile picture displayed).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By using the OBS websocket remote control, one can see the current recording time, and use that to generate the video editlist live without being the one running OBS.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OBS helper: would be nice to have a way to unmute both of us.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaborative-notes&quot;&gt;Collaborative notes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&#x27;t try to insert html into HackMD :sweat_smile:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD at this size seems to have worked, not all the time for everybody, but sufficiently.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using one HackMD for twitch and zoom was a good idea.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide plan for the day (including breaks and exercise plan) on top of HackMD and mention it at the beginning of the day.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When talking about HackMD, please share it, it gives people something to
look at.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add HackMD link to the workshop page and use the workshop page as main entry point so that participants don&#x27;t have to hunt for links in email inboxes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-and-tools&quot;&gt;Installation and tools&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having one conda environment with everything seems to have been a success. We have seen a lot less installation friction and trouble compared to earlier workshops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very useful feedback we got via email (paraphrasing with own words, also support this): Let us reconsider the choice of editors. We use &amp;quot;plain&amp;quot; nano but many of us use something else, use syntax highlighting, possibly Git integration. By leveling everybody to plain nano we risk giving the impression that this is how development is always done or should be done (no offense to those developing using plain nano in their work)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Quote:] One of my personal tips which we discussed a little in the breakout rooms was the use of a modern editor with syntax highlighting, ssh-to-remote, and git integration. We are actually doing a little post-workshop about this subject in my team this week. I totally understand that you do not wish to enforce a choice of editor for the participants during the workshop, but I think that some of the learners that are beginners to for instance version control, will think that plain Nano without any extras is how a lot of people work. Which I think is wrong, but again this is only my impression. I&#x27;m thinking about a modern editor as a tool you use to force yourself to make the right choices as a default, for instance, awareness of snake vs. camel naming convention. I also realize that this is a subject that might not fit under the &amp;quot;beginner&amp;quot; label for software. Maybe it would make sense to host a &amp;quot;Research Software Hour&amp;quot; with this as a topic?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;presenting-and-coordinating&quot;&gt;Presenting and coordinating&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordination plan should be continuously reviewed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong director role is needed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give clear message at the end of the day: Now the workshop day is concluded, stream and recording stopped. So that people that came for workshop content can leave, then have some official start of &#x27;afterparty&#x27;. It was not fully clear when the outro was finished.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it clear what someone needs to have open: Screenshare, HackMD, your terminal.  You get links to the episodes from HackMD.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid breaks between exercise explanation and doing exercise.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly mark interruptions&#x2F;speaking up during presentations as interruption (as in: not part of the presentation).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotlight video changes every time screenshare changes: It is defininitely still important to warn before stopping screen sharing (more than before)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Announcing &amp;quot;I&#x27;m about to take the screenshare&amp;quot; and waiting two seconds works
well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share screen for what you are talking about. Makes editing a bit easier.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When presenting, highlight or otherwise indicate on screen (not just temporarily) what you are talking about. It makes it much faster to scan through to make a good table of contents. Related: always show what is currently going on, like break times or pauses between exercises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-content&quot;&gt;Lesson content&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staging area: as usual, a difficult episode
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What parts of the episode is a dependency for other parts of CodeRefinery?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove it?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it clear it is advanced&#x2F;optional&#x2F;you won&#x27;t get it yet, when it is taught?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move it to the end?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication-with-participants&quot;&gt;Communication with participants&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indico: select &amp;quot;none&amp;quot; after selecting some registrants to for example sending emails (otherwise selection remain).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirmation of acceptance to the workshop should be done sooner. It may be too late if they get confirmed one week before the event and suddenly need to free up 6 half days.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As for the &amp;quot;team registrations&amp;quot;, as long they include an EL, we should send an acceptance ASAP.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding individual learners and ELs:
1) opening sign-up as individual ELs and to set its soft-deadline much earlier than for individual learners,
2) for individual learners, opening registration first as stream viewers only with an option of &#x27;want to join in interactive exercise sessions&#x27; yes&#x2F;no,
3) after the soft-deadline of individual ELs, to those who said &#x27;yes&#x27;, sending invitations to sign-up for zoom participation in another reg. form, and
4) accept the capacity of #individual ELs x 5 and otherwise put them in waitlist.
However, I actually want to suggest a quite wild idea rather than struggling with the dilemma of no-shows and withdrawal with very very short notice while not being able to accept all sign ups. Instead of coordinating for acceptance and grouping on backside, how about encouraging open&amp;amp;public self-organization of groups? somewhere everyone can access, &#x27;sign up&#x27; by writing their name, as a learner or EL, potentially also country, affiliation, background so that it might happen that they will self-organize a team. Once they can make a group of 6-7 people with at least one who can be acting as an EL, then their participation is sort of &#x27;confirmed&#x27;. This is different from team registration as this is primarily for those who want to join but cannot make a group will find others to make a group to join in the workshop.
Another thing is that the threshold of ELs could be even lower than some people may think. And I would say being an EL is probably better way to learn about the CodeRefinery lesson materials than joining as an learner. Especially if some people have already made their own team, one of them should be able to act as an EL, or they can even circulate the role among eath other.
And what I learned from the R+Tidyverse workshop until yesterday is that if a learner cannot turn on camera or mic (for any reason), it is almost no worth to join in a breakout room session, as HackMD Q&amp;amp;A will more or less perfectly solve the problem in that case.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<title>Towards citable lessons</title>
		<published>2021-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/21/towards-citable-lessons/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/21/towards-citable-lessons/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Autumn 2021 we have started to work on making our lessons and other material
we have created over the years, citable. At the same time we wish to assign a
digital object identifier (DOI) to each lesson so that the material becomes
persistent and remains findable. However, the main motivation for this work is
to get some metrics about the use of our material and also to give contributors
better credit and to make it possible for them to get and display metrics about
their contributions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effort is work in progress and in this document we will summarize our
discussions, decisions, findings, and observations so that we can then use
these later when we conclude this effort lesson by lesson.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-choices&quot;&gt;Technical choices&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use Zenodo because it is a well-established service which we know and
which integrates nicely with the repositories hosting the lessons and because
we will need to be able to update metadata (author information) without
changing the DOI record.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will convert the 3 remaining Jekyll lessons to Sphinx to simplify pdf export.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will not start with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allcontributors.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allcontributors.org&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; because it requires each contributor
to have a GitHub account which we have found a too strict limitation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We start with tracking authorship in CITATION.cff since GitHub presents a
&amp;quot;cite as&amp;quot; button when this file is present.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we find that CITATION.cff is not enough or does not provide the right
categories, we will try to track this in the .zenodo.json which Zenodo
understands and we could generate CITATION.cff from this file.  It seems that
if a .zenodo.json is present in a repo, it has on Zenodo precedence over a
CITATION.cff.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;distinguishing-authors-and-contributors&quot;&gt;Distinguishing authors and contributors&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed &amp;quot;code&amp;quot; (lesson material) does not mean removing authorship unless the author prefers to be removed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example for how Carpentries do it (unix shell lesson):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swcarpentry&#x2F;shell-novice&#x2F;blob&#x2F;gh-pages&#x2F;CITATION&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swcarpentry&#x2F;shell-novice&#x2F;blob&#x2F;gh-pages&#x2F;CITATION&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.5281&#x2F;zenodo.3266823&quot;&gt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.5281&#x2F;zenodo.3266823&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitions of the roles:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;creator&amp;quot;: significant contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot;&#x2F;Editor: reviewing&#x2F;approving contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot;&#x2F;Other: smaller contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Zenodo we start with &amp;quot;creator&amp;quot; (author) and &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; (other).
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See also categories that Zenodo understands: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.zenodo.org&#x2F;#representation&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.zenodo.org&#x2F;#representation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (search for &amp;quot;creators&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;contributors&amp;quot;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are a bit unsure whether one person can assume more than one role on
Zenodo. probably yes. If so, maybe one occurence for the highest
contribution is best.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still need to verify whether CITATION.cff and&#x2F;or .zenodo.json can map to
the definitions of roles (above).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-we-will-reach-out-to-creators-and-contributors&quot;&gt;How we will reach out to creators and contributors&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will do this on a per-lesson basis and we will start with the lessons
which we teach the most often.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributors are not only people who have contributed with Git commits, but
could also be people that contributed with input and ideas in other form.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reach out to everybody and ask whether they want to be contributor or author.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a person cannot be reached, we do not add the person without consent and
rather add the person later once we reach them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching out to creators and contributors will happen via GitHub issues close
to the lesson repository but those who do not respond or may not be on GitHub
will be reached via email.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the GitHub issue we will ask authors for their ORCID.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;archiving-lessons-as-pdf&quot;&gt;Archiving lessons as pdf&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When archiving lessons on Zenodo we have the choice of archiving the
repository as is (the sources) or to generate a pdf version of the lesson and
archiving the pdf.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have concluded that we wish to attempt depositing pdf versions unless this
turns out too difficult.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pdf versions will be generated automatically as part of a &amp;quot;release&amp;quot; workflow.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The automatic pdf generation is relatively straightforward with Sphinx
lessons but less trivial with Jekyll-based lessons.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will focus on Sphinx lessons and prefer converting Jekyll-based lessons to
Sphinx lessons rather than investing time in generating pdfs from Jekyll lessons.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But we have also concluded that cite-ability is more important than preserving
a pdf version of the lessons since we expect the lessons to evolve and be
continuously improved and the credit aspect is found more important than the
preservation aspect.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;orcid-vs-zenodo-community&quot;&gt;ORCID vs. Zenodo community&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have decided against introducing a project ORCID for CodeRefinery and
rather collect related records in a CodeRefinery Zenodo community.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-we-wish-to-test-the-workflow&quot;&gt;How we wish to test the workflow&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one or two example lessons we will create a fork and test the release
deployment and DOI generation on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandbox.zenodo.org&quot;&gt;Zenodo sandbox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;suggested-workflow-to-make-lessons-citable-via-zenodo&quot;&gt;Suggested workflow to make lessons citable via Zenodo&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a .zenodo.json to the lesson repo, for example:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;json&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;&quot; class=&quot;language-json &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d07711;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;creators&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: [

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        {   
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d07711;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;orcid&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#d07711;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;0000-0002-1825-0097&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ],
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate pdfs from Sphinx sources via LaTeX:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;conf.py&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;latex_engine = &#x27;xelatex&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (makes emojis work), then &lt;code&gt;make clean ; make latexpdf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will become part of GitHub Actions, it will not be a manual step.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a release of the lesson on GitHub.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2021/11/20/phase-2-lessons-learned/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this document was to collect lessons learned from phase 2 of
our project, both for our own future work but also for other future projects
who may find our experiences useful. We have chosen to collect the lessons
learned in bullet-point format and not in prose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we list experiences and also unsolved challenges from workshop
organization, lesson development, meeting minutes and decision tracking,
Carpentries membership, communication, data management, stakeholder- and
community engagement, and infrastructure hosting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;workshop-event-organization&quot;&gt;Workshop&#x2F;event organization&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we started teaching in 2016, we only worried about the teaching and not
about measuring how many participants from which country and from which
discipline and career stage. However, we were asked to report about metrics
again and again, on short notice. At some point we started reporting this in
detail &amp;lt;(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;&amp;gt;) which really simplified
reporting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;survey&quot;&gt;Survey&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Survey should be designed considering analysis and presentation of results,
as well as and what to focus on (what we want to show off).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When survey platform needs to be migrated to another, consider the structure
of the questions and answers to avoid tedious post-processing. Over the past
few years we have moved between platforms and also kept adapting questions
which made the analysis non-trivial.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get a better and precise overview of &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot; participants:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both pre-&#x2F;post-workshop surveys are opt-in, and they should be. In principle, sign-up form should collect only very necessary information for those to be able to participate in the workshop, and thus it may not be optimal to collect learner-profile type of information via sign-up form (at least not as mandatory fields), except for cases where we need to apply priority criteria or treating participants differently (e.g. team participation, grouping according to background so that they can work on different exercises etc.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-workshop survey: so far submitted by anyone voluntarily upon sign-up. Not necessarily all the submitters are participating in the workshop, neither all the actual participants submitted the pre-workshop survey. It might be an idea to ask them to submit upon acceptance to increase accuracy to some extent. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-workshop survey: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs a scheduled reminder to the organizer side have consistency in the time between the workshop and the survey timing, as the survey aims to see the long-term effect of the workshop. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is inevitable risks that the survey invitation cannot reach the email address registered after a half year or such, and of course we cannot expect very high response rate, either. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another limitation that we need to think of could be that the chances could be higher for those who had positive impression would submit the post-workshop survey than those who had negative impression, which will naturally yield biased results.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacity-and-workshop-format&quot;&gt;Capacity and workshop format&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to afford as many as possible learners while keeping good learner experiences
or even improving them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we carried out online workshops in 2020-2021: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard 3-full day CR workshop was transformed into 6-half day format, typically Tuesday-Thursday over 2 consecutive weeks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helper&#x2F;Exercise lead onboarding sessions as well as installation help drop-in sessions were held typically a week before the 1st week.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the exercises were done in breakout room with a group of regular members. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We recruited exercise leads and accepted 5-6 individual learners per exercise lead plus team registration including their own exercise lead.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used priority criteria based on countries and&#x2F;or institution&#x27;s characteristics.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems&#x2F;challenges we experienced:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdrawals on short notices and no-shows&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much hassles by the coordinators&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback showing both positive and negative experiences with regular members&#x2F;exercise leads &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the optimal format of help provision and exercises: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should the group members be fixed or more ad-hoc or even hop-in-and-out? &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is one regular exercise lead always needed per group? One disadvantage of not-having regular exercise lead is that it takes time to call help, explaining situation etc., which eats up exercise time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Webinar (stream)-by default&amp;quot; with an option for joining in zoom-meeting room for extra help may work better (ref. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scicomp.aalto.fi&#x2F;training&#x2F;scip&#x2F;python-for-scicomp&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Python for SciComp 2021&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-workshop Q&amp;amp;A session time&#x2F;day would be useful? &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have considered for the future to offer optional exercise walk-through sessions. These could be
interesting not only for learners but recording of these sessions could also help future
exercise leads.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;communication-with-participants&quot;&gt;Communication with participants&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indico&#x27;s email function worked well to send information about the workshop to participants&#x2F;signers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We experienced few cases of typo in email address, thus we could not reach registrants.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online collaborative notebook (HackMD and similar) worked well for Q&amp;amp;A during the lectures. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;certificates&quot;&gt;Certificates&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should CR issue any certificate at all? Certificates became participation certificates and possibly we should delegate certification to participating organizations.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tudelft.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;library&#x2F;research-data-management&#x2F;r&#x2F;training-events&#x2F;training-for-researchers&#x2F;code-refinery-workshop&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;TU Delft PhD candidates can obtain 2 GS credits (Research skills) when attending and actively participating in the workshop (complete assistance)&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - It may be better that each institute would have one responsible for approval of students&#x27; (or similar) active participation in any of the CR workshops as part of the study etc rather than CR takes responsibility on their participation by checking their records in Zoom etc. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;phase-2-lessons-learned&#x2F;#Legal-questions&quot;&gt;Legal questions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) Issuing certificates may have some problems with data management including personal information.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;planning&quot;&gt;Planning&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term scheduling with fixed twice-per-year schedule is probably better than juggling many calendars and trying to find a time slot 1 month in advance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning relevant workshops&#x2F;events before and after the CR big workshops will be also helpful. They include for example Software Carpentry, Python for SciComp, Hackathon, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-development&quot;&gt;Lesson development&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only happened before workshops. This was very efficient but introduced stress.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It probably requires a calendar event to dedicate time for this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;software installation and setup&amp;quot; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not lesson itself, but this also needs to be updated along the lesson development and improvement as well as along the changes implemented in different software programs, packages and platforms to use (e.g. GitHub).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The procedures need validations given diverse scenarios.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction of step-wise procedures with prepared Conda environment worked well, we had considerably fewer visits to installation-help sessions (no statistics, though, it is staff&#x27;s impression).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to the cases where one sends PR with all the team members assigned as reviewers, lesson improvement works better when done in a pair; one takes revision work, while the other does a thorough review. Often assigning all the team members as reviewers make the responsibility unclear and ends up with the PM (or in a better case, a few regularly active members) reviews and merges.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to make the contribution criteria clear for making lesson citable:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“creator”(author): significant contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“contributor”&#x2F;Editor: reviewing&#x2F;approving contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“contributor”&#x2F;Other: smaller contributions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ref: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackmd.io&#x2F;@coderefinery&#x2F;citable-lessons&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In view of marketing as well as convincing funders, it would be worth collecting information about where the lesson materials are used. It will be an idea to have a form to submit where it can ask the following questions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institution&#x2F;Organization etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of event and link to the event page:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credited course&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-credited course&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other type (specify) &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which lessons were used
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only CR lessons (which ones)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CR lessons (which ones) as well as other lesson materials (what materials?)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For each membership year, NeIC had 15 priority seats for the instructor training and 6 COWs without fee.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regarding the membership year 2020-2021; 3 trainees who took the instructor training are planning to finish the rest of the checkout procedures within this year. 1 of them remains as pending in the Carpentries database at the time of 26th Oct.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RC did follow-up check-ins for the trainees who attended a training event. Regarding 2019-2020, 4 trainees from the same institute failed check-out (1 of them could not complete the participation in the training event due to absence more than an hour) despite repetitive check-ins. 1 trainees in 2020-2021 became unreachable after the training event.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.org&#x2F;community&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CodeRefinery&#x27;s Zulip chat is introduced as a Carpentries local community space for Nordics and Baltics.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended at membership exective council meetings (2020 by RA, 2021 by NT).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2021, CodeRefinery hosted a workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;2021-01-08-coderefinery-online&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Introduction to Conda for (Data) Scientists&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;call-for-pilot-workshops-carpentries-incubator&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Carpentries pilot program to improve the lesson material in the incubator program to further level&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carpentries Executive Director provided a support letter upon the application for the sustainability phase.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeRefinery has re-licensed their lesson material from CC-BY-SA to CC-BY based on a suggestion by the Carpentries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-coordinator-rc&quot;&gt;Regional Coordinator (RC)&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the priod where the RC role was given as a part of tasks by a CodeRefinery project staff, the RC had an administrative role within the Carpentries on both COWs and SOWs in the relevant region. In total, appointed RC carried out administrative works on &lt;strong&gt;35 workshops&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In addition, she recorded 28 past SOWs hosted by University of Oslo, which were eligible to be recorded in the Carpentries database but had not been registered.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RC initiated the following: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.topicbox.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;local-nordic&quot;&gt;Nordic region mailing list at topic-box (managed by the Carpentries)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;2020.carpentrycon.org&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;#session-48&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Nordic and Baltic Get Together&amp;quot; session at CarpentryCon 2020 @home&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codimd.carpentries.org&#x2F;nordic-community-call&quot;&gt;monthly community calls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RC explained and guided about the NeIC&#x27;s membership benefit and the Carpentries workshops, as well as bridging new individuals to the region to the local community upon requests. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon the expiration of the NeIC&#x27;s membership, RC in Nordic region is also discontinued.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;dissemination-of-opportunities-to-use-the-neic-s-membership-benefit&quot;&gt;Dissemination of opportunities to use the NeIC&#x27;s membership benefit&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissemination of opportunities were done via CR and NeIC website, CR Zulip chat, CR newsletter, at relevant workshops, CR twitter, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, presentations at conferences etc. (for example at &amp;quot;Seminar for bibliotekenes nettverk for ph.d.-støtte&amp;quot; (In Norway)) were also used to disseminate opportunities. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;uptake-of-the-membership-benefits&quot;&gt;Uptake of the membership benefits&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits were generally underused, especially COW opportunities. This was partially due to the pandemic and that requests for online COW were not accepted for the first several months after the pandemic hit. Also, the difficulty in planning in-person workshops may have also influenced here as well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructor training&#x27;s three check-out procedures seem a bit high barrier for some people. Follow-up by RC seemed to have helped to some extent, for example, reminding them to apply for extension of the due date to complete the check-out, offering opportunity to join in Nordic community call as a part of check-out processes, and some advices on contribution works (e.g., translation of terms in Glosario). &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provision of teaching&#x2F;learning opportunities in Carpentries SOWs&#x2F;COWs initiated by CR might have been helping; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to disseminate the usefulness of the Carpentries workshops, as well as &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide a &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; place for newly-badged instructors to try teaching. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NB: There was a plan to attempt this idea by a SOW for 2021, and several newly badged instructors showed interest in teaching there. But then there was a request for a new COW, and those new instructors had a chance to teach there.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Carpentries is also changing along time:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Membership price model and the price itself had been stable for a couple of years, but will be changed within 2021.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RC role is to be changed in the process of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;announcing-community-development-program&#x2F;&quot;&gt;re-designing community development program&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. RC will no longer have responsibility for administrative works on workshops in the responsible region. This is also explained as due to a concern around GDPR raised by the major sponsor of the Carpentries (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communityin.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Community Initiatives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). The discount offer of having an RC is to be discontinued. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Carpentries will have online workshops as their standard option to offer in near future; it is so far only as pilot.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;meeting-minutes-and-decision-tracking&quot;&gt;Meeting minutes and decision tracking&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One rolling meeting minutes document is probably better than one document per
meeting to track tasks and decisions. Creating new documents for each meeting risks
that action points get lost or forgotten.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-reporting-and-vacation-planning&quot;&gt;Time reporting and vacation planning&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the project we have early on chosen to not report hours to the project
management to build trust (only report hours to the local management).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But in hind sight the project manager should have had a closer overview over reported hours
earlier, not with a delay of months between work done, work reported to local
management, work invoiced to NeIC, and NeIC management informing the project
manager about hours invoiced.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been work imbalance among the team: the contribution and buy-in was not the uniform among
all participating countries&#x2F;organizations (taking into account different FTE shares).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In hindsight, it would have been better to offer more 1-1 discussions between
project manager and staff.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over time there has been significant staff fluctuation which is normal but every time it takes
time to know the routines and grow mutual trust and to get up to speed with the tools and processes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reduces confusion to share a vacation plan: not only for the project
manager but for the entire staff.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;issue-task-tracking&quot;&gt;Issue&#x2F;task tracking&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process of having a centralized task tracking was found to be
difficult to implement in a decentralized team where everyone has other &#x27;primary&#x27; projects.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the first two project terms we have tried different tools:
Trello, GitHub project board, GitHub issues, HackMD, but
it seems no tool replaces 1-1 discussions and more personalized task planning and one or
few persons keeping the overview and re-prioritizing from time to time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, having one HackMD document that collects all tasks that we chose to
work on and keeping this document across bi-weekly calls has been found
useful.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;support-line-request-tracker&quot;&gt;Support line&#x2F; request tracker&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got roughly 200-300 tickets&#x2F;year.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started with email to project manager but that got too much, then we moved to
ZenDesk but we had to pay for each agent and it felt expensive for the very
few emails we got per week.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNIC has kindly provided us with the RequestTracker service which we appreciate but the barrier
to authenticate using SSL certificates was too high for a cross-border
project and for few staff members it took weeks or months to get access.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most tickets arrive around workshops.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most non-workshop tickets were to unblock GitLab accounts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication-within-the-community-and-the-project&quot;&gt;Communication within the community and the project&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started within NeIC Slack.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a major problem, because we don&#x27;t want to (or are unsure how to) keep lists of
contacts&#x2F;interested people (personal data), so we don&#x27;t have a way to reach out to a broad audience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although we have accumulated a large dataset of contact information, we had to delete this information
and could not use it to announce other events since we never asked registrants whether they
would prefer being informed about related events.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are unsure however, whether the problem with outreach is lack of tools or lack of processes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One way out is to move communication to the public space which we have
done when moving from Slack to Zulip.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally Zulip chat has been good for the project.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition, we have managed to engage many helpers and volunteers for each workshop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When contracted staff are working on different percentages and remotely, it is important
to have clear overview of who is working on what and when, otherwise it may give the feeling of
unfairness. Frequent short meetings in &amp;quot;Standup&amp;quot;-format (or even writing asynchronously on Zulip or GitHub
project etc.) may help all having a better overview and enable us to regularly follow up each other.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimizing the toolset has been found beneficial since everybody already has a set of tools to
interact with in other projects and these tools often do not overlap or inter-operate.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-management&quot;&gt;Data management&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive has served us well in the first years.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this storage was connected to a personal account.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over time we used GitHub more and more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD was used a lot in the last 2 years of the project, both for workshops and notes and meetings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have never defined who owns the data and this created a bit of work for the project management towards the end of the project phase.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should have created a data management plan.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relevant to some points written in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;phase-2-lessons-learned&#x2F;#Legal-questions&quot;&gt;Legal questions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-engagement&quot;&gt;Community engagement&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a constant stream of people interested in becoming more involved.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have activated some, but as &#x27;communication&#x27; says above, some potential was left unrealized.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing a community requires also promoting newcomers and mentoring.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentoring also requires volunteer mentors.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With more mentoring and more follow-up we could have had engaged more people and more organizations.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to give proper credits to the volunteer effort given to the community; do we need different
&amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; as well as types (e.g. lesson contributions or exercise leads) of contributions?
Ref. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cscce.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;octobers-community-call-recap-supporting-community-champions-and-running-champions-programs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Supporting community champions and running champions programs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to keep the community engagement up and running without &amp;quot;burn-out&amp;quot; is a constant challenge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-engagement&quot;&gt;Stakeholder engagement&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steering group seems to have become less engaged over time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of the project the SG actively influenced and gave ideas and input and suggestions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over time the steering group meetings and communication grew more and more
passive and turned into a reporting channel.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project had only 3 short meetings with the reference group formed by national
training coordinators. This was somehow beneficial to connect to national newsletters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure-hosting-gitlab-service&quot;&gt;Infrastructure hosting (GitLab service)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the steering group and also the project staff became less interested in this over time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the GitLab service turned out successful, it became more and more disconnected and disengaged
and ended up a two-person effort (one person maintaining service, another person answering tickets).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-questions&quot;&gt;Legal questions&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project was lacking support in GDPR-related questions
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We felt a bit left alone with questions about data privacy and storage
and collaboration. For example: how long can we keep participants&#x27; data
to issue certificates? Should we keep information of the certificates
issued? If so, how long, who and where eventually will keep them in case
the project ends?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employer organizations, preferably their lawyers should be consulted,
especially in terms of making a project&#x27;s privacy policy and choice of
common cloud-based platforms that are inevitable to use. As an example, UiO lawyers
have raised concern about using work email address for making user account of any
cost-free cloud service (including GitHub) so that users don&#x27;t set the
same password as the one used at the work. In addition, it was not
encouraged to use any cloud-service based in the US to store any personal
data (even not sensitive ones) for work-related purpose given the risk
that &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uio.no&#x2F;for-ansatte&#x2F;arbeidsstotte&#x2F;personvern&#x2F;gdpr&#x2F;aktuelt&#x2F;endelige-retningslinjer-for-overforing-ut-av-eos.html&quot;&gt;GDPR is not followed due to its server existence outside of the EU
(especially in
US)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(Ref. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edpb.europa.eu&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;2021-06&#x2F;edpb_recommendations_202001vo.2.0_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf&quot;&gt;Recommendations by European Data Protection
Board&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given its characteristics, NeIC should provide both necessary legal
support on the issues relevant to GDPR and common cloud-based platforms
that staff across boarder securely use. Common support email and a
platform where more than one project staff can answer inquiries
regardless of their affiliation is essential (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;phase-2-lessons-learned&#x2F;#Support-line&quot;&gt;Support
line&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; section).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeRefinery is (and has become) a very much community-driven project
rather than one where only fixed staff work with written contract through
the employer. Such project may have been rare, but there might be more of
this type in future. Clear legal guideline for involvement of voluntary
staff is needed. In this sense, working contract or collaboration
agreements including data processor agreement may not be sufficient and
it will need a very clear guideline about who should be able to have
access to any personal information of the third parties including sign-up
information to workshops, for example.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Rights to work results&amp;quot; vs. Open Science
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ref: a page about &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uio.no&#x2F;english&#x2F;for-employees&#x2F;employment&#x2F;work-results&#x2F;rights-to-work-results.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Rights to work results&amp;quot; at University of Oslo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General clarification is needed here so that everyone won&#x27;t be in trouble later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be also better explained and clarified in terms of the choice of platform for collaborative works in this regard so that staff&#x2F;volunteers etc. can feel safe in using the chosen (cloud-based) platforms, including GitHub, YouTube, Twitch, HackMD, Tinyletter etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also lacked support in questions about how to start an own organization&#x2F; spin-off.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CodeRefinery is now shifting towards a new phase with community-based collaboration. We are aiming to continue offering the workshops, community space, and develop lesson materials together with those who are interested in. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to be successful, CodeRefinery started bi-weekly community calls from the 9th August. Calls are open to anyone interested in joining in the community from any point of view; teaching, learning, hosting, contributing to lessons, you name it. Join in the calls, get informed and influence the community&#x27;s way forward! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we informed and discussed among others;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CodeRefinery project: current status and future,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to improve outreach and publicity,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance of possibility to provide ECTS,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How CodeRefinery should give credits to contributions by volunteers,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentorship program for exercise leads after the workshop,&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; workshops&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details of each call, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coderefinery&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;commits&#x2F;main&#x2F;content&#x2F;about&#x2F;community-call.md&quot;&gt;the archive of the minutes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next call is on the 6th September 12:00-13:00 CEST with a theme of &amp;quot;CodeRefinery way forward&amp;quot;, where we will be discussing the community organization model. For the connection details and agenda, please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackmd.io&#x2F;@coderefinery&#x2F;community-call&quot;&gt;the Community Call HackMD&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Community discussion in Nordic and Baltic countries</title>

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/11/13/carpentry-community-discussion-nordic/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blogpost is based on the notes made on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pad.carpentries.org&#x2F;community-discussions&quot;&gt;Carpentries Community Discussion Etherpad&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the 30th Oct. 2020.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Carpentries say &amp;quot;never touch learners keyboard&amp;quot;. Should instructors rigidly follow this advice in online workshops or should we be more flexible in order to overcome the challenges of teaching online?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 30th 2020, a Carpentries community discussion was held with discussion focused on Nordic and Baltic countries. The host was Annika Rockenberger (Carpentries instructor trainer). Including the host and the co-host, totally 15 participants joined: 6 from Norway, 3 from Sweden, 3 from Finland, 2 from Denmark, and 1 from Bangladesh (Thanks for joining, all!). A complete list of the participants can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;carpentry-community-discussion-nordic&#x2F;#Participant-list&quot;&gt;below&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, experiences from 2 online workshops were shared. The theme above was raised as a part of the discussion. The active discussion left little time for other topics, but we had a positive and creative suggestion for further collaboration and community building for Nordic and Baltic region: There was a suggestion for running a joint workshop on AR technology and the idea to create a mapping of expertise in the region to facilitate cross-border collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ongoing initiatives to develop Nordic community further. Among other things, information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Nordic Research Software Engineer initiative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;events&#x2F;2020-online-get-together&#x2F;&quot;&gt;first online get-together event on 30th Nov. - 2nd Dec.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was announced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop-debriefing&quot;&gt;Workshop debriefing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiences from two recently held online Carpentries workshops were shared and discussed:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sweden-stockholm-mix-and-match-sql-openrefine-python-programming-and-plotting&quot;&gt;Sweden, Stockholm -- Mix and Match (SQL, OpenRefine, Python programming and plotting)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linajandren.github.io&#x2F;2020-09-22-stockholmtrio-online&#x2F;&quot;&gt;A self-organized workshop by KTH, Stockholm University, and Karolinska Institute&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lina, instructor of this workshop) Felt it was hard to teach online, as she was unsure if it reached to the audience. But it went fine.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Radovan) (In his experiences from teaching online workshops in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;carpentry-community-discussion-nordic&#x2F;coderefinery.org&quot;&gt;CodeRefinery&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) Jumping into breakout rooms to see how the participants did in exercise sessions helped a lot. Also being able to ask&#x2F;answer questions asynchronously via HackMD hopefully lowers barrier to ask (does not delay others).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Annika) Even being able to see helpers&#x27; faces would help despite having all the learners camera off. Also, when breakout room size is small, it is easier to get impression of the learners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;norway-bodo-dc-social-science&quot;&gt;Norway, Bodø -- DC social science&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mchiapello.github.io&#x2F;2020-09-16-nord-online&#x2F;&quot;&gt;A centrally-organized workshop at Bodø University&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lars, instructor of this workshop) Breakout rooms helped as it enhanced dialog. One of the key issues in the Carpentries. Remote control function worked well. The other instructor used this function to help a learner in the main room. It took some time to build trust.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Anne) &amp;quot;Taking over learner&#x27;s keyboard on an in-person workshop should never happen&amp;quot;, the Carpentries says! But this concept could be too rigid. This should be given back as feedback to the Carpentries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lina) Depending on the context?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Annika) Communicating the principles and the important parts for not leaving participants behind in critical situation would be the essential thing to consider when taking over keyboard or not.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Joakim) Important thing is not give pressure on instructors.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lina) Letting learners take over instructor&#x27;s screen would be interesting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lars) Polls for ice-breakers as well. Easy to rush through, but important not to, especially when you cannot see faces as feedback.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Radovan) Hopefully useful tips for online teaching learned from CodeRefinery workshops: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<title>git-pr: painless small pull requests</title>
		<published>2020-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/09/29/git-pr/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-pr-painless-small-pull-requests&quot;&gt;git-pr: painless small pull requests&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CodeRefinery, we teach the benefit of small changes via pull
requests in order to have better collaboration and review.  But, when
the changes get small enough, the time it takes to run the commands
and open the pull requests begins to get annoying.  I looked around
for other tools that could make this faster, but wasn&#x27;t quite
satisfied with anything.  So, I slowly started making something that
evolved into git-pr, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;git-pr&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;git-pr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about how it works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-a-change&quot;&gt;Making a change&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, git-pr will help you to make the new feature branch.  &lt;code&gt;git pr branch $branch_name&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; willcreate a new feature branch off of the
upstreamdefault branch and check it out for you.  You might want to
&lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; first.  Make your commits off of this branch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One trick I use is to write the first commit&#x27;s message like I would
write the pull request description.  I decided it&#x27;s usually not worth
writing a separate description for the pull request itself.  Perhaps
there is some advantage to including the PR message in the git history
itself, too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to push the pull request, I use &lt;code&gt;git pr open&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.  This will push
the current branch, and open a pull request on both Github and Gitlab.
It will pop up an editor pre-seeded with the commit&#x27;s message for you
to further edit.  Once you save and close, the pull request is made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that git-pr will do is figure out the upstream and your
local copy by yourself.  Default upstream goes in priority order
&lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;origin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, Default personal fork goes in the order
&lt;code&gt;local&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;origin&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;upstream&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, so no matter if you first clone the
upstream, or your own fork, you can always add the other with only one
command and have it auto-detected with no renaming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pr prune&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; will remove all merged branches both locally and on the
remote (possibly dangerous!).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various &lt;code&gt;git pr fetch*&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; commands will fetch pull requests into a local
&lt;code&gt;pr&#x2F;NNN&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various other small useful things, with it, but this is the
main part.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; shorthands for things you can easily do with other
git commands, but they save you time.  It gets me closer to the ideal
of making many small pull requests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-git-pr&quot;&gt;About git-pr&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find it at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;git-pr&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;git-pr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - it is a
single shell script to copy to your path.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s beta-quality software: it is used by me and a few others all the
time, but there will almost certainly be issues as others start using
it.  Send issues and PRs!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It supports both Github and Gitlab, though Gitlab support is less well
tested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of prior art on different pieces here, there isn&#x27;t much
in git-pr that is completely new - In particular, the GitHub command
line interface has come out since then and has some overlap.  You can
see other options in the git-pr README.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Report from the Mega-Coderefinery workshop</title>
		<published>2020-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In May&#x2F;June 2020, CodeRefinery ran a large online workshop with about
100 learners in attendance.  We overcame the challenges with some
clever strategies, and we feel the learning outcomes were similar to that of in-person workshops of around 30-40 participants.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that workshop, some of the same staff held an even larger
&amp;quot;High-performance computing (HPC) Kickstart&amp;quot; workshop (180 learners,
more than four universities).  This provided another perspective and
reinforced some of the lessons learned during the large online
CodeRefinery workshop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a 100-person workshop seems like an intimidating goal, but
with the right vision and techniques it turned out to be quite smooth.
Instead of expecting direct instructor interaction with every learner,
we had to accept that everyone could be both a helper and learner and
create a hierarchical support structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online is not simply a temporary substitute for in-person.
Mega-online is not simply a way to reach more people because we don&#x27;t
have instructors.  This concept fundamentally takes us closer to the
promise of technology for teaching: being able to reach everyone
regardless of location and physical limitations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive summary&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, we scale to 100 people pretty well, but you do need a good
vision about how to do it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We maintained good learning outcomes with our adjusted strategies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers are essential and need to be trained.  Helpers serve as a
first-level of support, and instructors&#x2F;expert helpers serve as a
second. Helpers need training in breakout room management and a
walk-through&#x2F;training in the group exercises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage the social aspect by asking for people to register as part
of teams and keep the teams together.  Teams can even bring their
own helper - or even helpers (learners in previous CodeRefinery) can
bring their own learners to spread their knowledge to their
colleagues.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to put in extra effort to ensure things run smoothly and
make sure that everyone is prepared - anticipate all problems.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles of staff should be carefully explained and ideally not
overlapping, to reduce the cognitive load.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organization&quot;&gt;Organization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-workshop install help times:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasis on getting ready and making sure things are installed
and configured.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; everyone to attend one pre-workshop installation
time, even if they thought they had already done it (in this
case, we quickly verified the instllation).  In practice, we
didn&#x27;t check this requirement and only 25-50% of people came,
but it still make the workshop more smooth.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The installation verification time occurred right after the
&amp;quot;helper introduction meeting&amp;quot;, so helpers would stay and help
people verify their installation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installation instructions consist not just of installation, but also
verification instructions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular, verifying of the git configuration, since if
there are any issues, it very quickly derails things.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We created installation and verification videos for the most
critical part, git &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg&quot;&gt;youtube
playlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One on verifying an installation (make repo, run it)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One for most common problems you might see and how to fix&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One for advanced topics (ssh keys)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the meeting 20-30 minutes before, request joining 10 minutes
early (on time is late).  Have some sort of
icebreakers&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;program to fill that 10 minutes to keep
people interested.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We kept the Zoom meeting room open for 30 min to 1 hour after the scheduled lessons are over on that day.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This enabled continuation of exercises in re-opening breakout rooms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some participants could receive individual help by a helper or an expert helper.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the main room, we did debriefing among instructors and helpers so that we could reflect on the day after.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The larger the audience gets, the more diverse it is.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This causes more load on helpers and more effort for organizers
to prepare.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also makes it harder to please everyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But on average, we felt that the outcome was about as expected.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To scale to this cognitive load, carefully assign roles (roles
explained below):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom host, focuses on chat, breakout rooms, registration, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD master&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expert helpers (special ops)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is best if these roles don&#x27;t overlap, because they require
different types of focus.  Zoom host and HackMD master are
easiest to combine.  Then, instructor and expert helpers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place a large emphasis on getting ready for the workshop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have multiple ways for learners to verify their installation.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Require&amp;quot; attendance in pre-workshop installation verification
times.  Invite helpers there to get involved and practice basic
helping.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;teams&quot;&gt;Teams&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recruitment&#x2F;sign-up strategy was twofold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open call for helpers and sign-up for individual learners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Bring your own breakout room”:  We allowed learners to register as &lt;strong&gt;teams&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, where each team brought its own helper.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-call-for-helpers-and-sign-up-for-individual-learners&quot;&gt;Open call for helpers and sign-up for individual learners.&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First we had a general call for helpers to assign a breakout room with individual learners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our plan was to allocate one helper for 5 learnes accepted approx. (the number of helpers) * 5 of individual leraner sign-ups.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tried to sort these learners by university&#x2F;country&#x2F;field, but didn&#x27;t put too much effort into this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers and learners were told which team they will be in before the workshop (personalized email with breakout room number).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, we tried to keep consistency in member composition in a breakout room throughout the whole workshop; with the same learnes and the same helper, as much as possible.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a long workshop like this one (6 half-days), getting to know each other seemed to result in more interaction by the end.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random assignments might work better in a smaller workshop, where you are likely to see the same people you know.  That isn&#x27;t the case in a large workshop, so consistent breakout rooms are more worth it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It took a session or two for people to get comfortable with their room, but once they did it went well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bring-your-own-breakout-room&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Bring your own breakout room&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To further improve things, imagine if a whole group wants to get trained?  They can register and bring their own helper, who could be an advanced group member.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research shows that multiple adopters in an organization greatly increases uptake of new tools (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11301-017-0133-3&quot;&gt;Graf-Vlachy, L., Buhtz, K. &amp;amp; König, 2018&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Encourage people to come with friends or groupmates.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it worked:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is implemented as a &amp;quot;Team name&amp;quot; option when registering.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are put in their own breakout room together.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Because they bring their own helper, we can scale to essentially as many learners as we want.This mechanism allowed us to reach far more people than we could normally, and allowed anyone who could find their own helper to attend. So, our workshop size became SUM(number of people in a team; number of teams) + (number of helpers)*6: every teamless helper directly allowed five other learners to attend.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team building&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Because these learners have a pre-existing social connection, they are able to keep a sense of community and help each other much better than you might expect from a course of this size.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possibility to use familiar examples&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: We have observed that some team breakout rooms were discussing examples close to their research domain which would otherwise have been difficult to do in a &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; group room or the main room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of teams could be extended to in-person workshops, too.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not necessarily pre-assigned, but cleverly organize tables, expect the group to stay together all days.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One could give the teams names and so on, to increase team spirit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-1&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept a &amp;quot;team name&amp;quot; as part of registration.  These people will be
put into the same breakout rooms.  Worst case, it isn&#x27;t used.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep people in the same breakout room for the entire workshop - if
there is risk that people will not get used to interacting with
their group.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;breakout-rooms-management&quot;&gt;Breakout rooms management&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign names depending on breakout room and role.  Here, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the
breakout room number:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(n) First Last&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; - learner&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(n,H) First Last&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; - helper&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the above help you to easily assign to the correct breakout
rooms, and becomes fairly easy with the Zoom interface. When
there are more than 10 teams, it is recommended to use &#x27;01&#x27;,
&#x27;02&#x27;, .. as it makes it even easier to organize them into
breakout rooms manually.(Otherwise participant list sorts (10),
not (2), right after (1))&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(CR) First Last&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for instructors and expert helpers (here &amp;quot;CR&amp;quot;
stood for CodeRefinery staff).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial breakout room assignments serves as a guideline, rooms are
constantly adjusted as needed but we try to keep teams together.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferably, one breakout room should have minimum 4 learners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people register as a team together, keep them together unless
explicitly asked.  For others, do what you need, but realize that
the social aspect becomes important.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people don&#x27;t join with the right Zoom name.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other co-hosts can browse the registration list and manually
rename participants who didn&#x27;t name themselves correctly.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, the Zoom host only has to worry about assigning them into
the right rooms, and not looking up everyone on the lists.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our registration system, Indico, made this management much easier
than it could have been.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After registration closed, we added a &amp;quot;Room&amp;quot; field to the
registration data.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we went through and manually assigned each person to an
appropriate room number.  We have to make sure that each room
has one helper and an appropriate number of learners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could send personalized messages to each person with the
Indico mail merge function&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of people did manage to name themselves correctly.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-2&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent naming of participants (and an order that sorts properly)
makes managing breakout rooms reasonable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider how your registration system can send personalized emails
to each person.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;helper-training&quot;&gt;Helper training&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular helpers:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a helper call the previous week.  Actually, have two so that
everyone can make it to at least one.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helper training:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;helping-and-teaching&#x2F;&quot;&gt;General&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;breakout-rooms-helping&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Breakout rooms&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on training for managing time and keeping a flow going.  This
is described in our document.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers do not need to be experts in everything.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should be able to know what &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; looks like, see
obvious problems, and then call for help from an expert when
something will take more than a minute to resolve.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helper training is focused on:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation of learners and teaching psychology.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to help: don&#x27;t do it for them, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping the flow going, encourage everyone to speak up and
share.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing when and how to call for an expert helper to come to the
room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special expert helpers:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also &amp;quot;special expert helpers&amp;quot; (we need a new name), who
are experts in the material and problems that may come up.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most are instructors or could soon become instructors (though
really they need to be expert debuggers).  Basically many of our
free instructors would hang around to serve as special experts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special experts aren&#x27;t assigned to any particular breakout room.
Instead, they are able to go to any room that needs more help.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While no room is calling them, they swap between rooms: they
join a room, wait a bit (30-60s) and watch if it&#x27;s going ok,
before moving to another room.  This way, the instructors can
always be aware of the pulse of the breakout rooms, pro-actively
help, and also provide more mentorship to the helpers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One idea was to have expert helpers begin joining breakout rooms
only after 1&#x2F;3rd of the breakout session is over.  This ensures
that helpers get a chance to do their thing.  This needs some
thought.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special experts provide valuable feedback to the instructor on the
progress of all learners.  They should bring up some of the most
important issues they have seen in the main room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special experts also serve as backup helpers and can take over or
permanently join a room if a helper is unprepared.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructor is also encouraged to pop into some breakout rooms to
see how things are going.  This may be enough in small workshops.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special experts should be Zoom co-hosts.  They are then able to go
into any breakout room they want (the mechanics of this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
obvious, see our helper training info for more).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special experts are different than the Zoom host and hackmd master.
These jobs require different types of concentration.  Helpers and
expert helpers need to carefully follow what the instructor is
saying, Zoom host&#x2F;hackmd master follow learner questions, and
up-next instructors think about what they are about to do.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-3&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical helpers allows you to extend to a greater size.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to put thought into how helpers work and prepare them well.
We should develop a special, quick training for them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special expert helpers connect the instructor (occupied with
teaching) to the pulse of the breakout rooms and serve as helper
mentors.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson-adjustment&quot;&gt;Lesson adjustment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the exercise sessions as long as possible, group things
together.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a significant overhead to each breakout session,
becoming adjusted, figure out just what it is you are supposed
to do.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type-along is hard, given limited screen space to both watch and do.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, the main room was more for lectures and watch an
example, then we flipped to breakout rooms to do most of the
hands-on work.  We still need to think about this more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With hierarchical helpers and more people in general, make sure that
each exercise and hands-on session is as self-contained as possible.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person familiar with the tools should be able to read the
exercise and figure out what the objective is and what the steps
are - not having to pay attention to something said 5 minutes
ago, and not having a surprise twist that somehow had to be
accommodated at the beginning of the exercise.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-4&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider limits of online formats and how difficult it is to do
interactive work.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercises-and-breakout-sessions&quot;&gt;Exercises and breakout sessions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very clearly say what the goal is, what the duration is (duration
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; time it ends), etc. for each lesson&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the basic info in hackmd for each exercise: link to it, what
you are expected to do, how long it is and clock time when it ends
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. &amp;quot;we expect you to finish 1-3, 4-5 are optional.  20
minutes, ending at xx:45&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When participants are in two time zones, it is extra important
to use this format of not specifying hour.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is exactly the case of &amp;quot;if it&#x27;s even a little bit slow to you,
then it takes ages for a learner to understand&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-5&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have lots of &amp;quot;meta-talk&amp;quot; about what you are doing, what expectations
are, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hackmd&quot;&gt;HackMD&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD serves as a side channel to answer questions, so that the
main flow is not disrupted.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learners keep it open and always watch and ask questions at the
bottom.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person serves as the &amp;quot;HackMD master&amp;quot; who follows it, answers,
and most importantly keeps it organized and adds in meta-information
about what the course does.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best if there is one person dedicated to
this without any other distractions (but of course many others
help, too).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful about answering questions in too much depth, more than is
needed.  If you do, text becomes overwhelming and people can&#x27;t
follow.  Be strategic: if an answer isn&#x27;t needed for following the
course, say so (and if you want, come back and answer later).
Answer the minimum to let someone follow the course, and inspire
people to research themselves later. Several short bullet points
progressively going into more depth makes for fast reading but also
more inspiration.  For example this point, it&#x27;s a bit long and
intimidating to read, which makes you lose the flow of whatever else
you are watching, isn&#x27;t it?  Imagine if every bullet point was like
this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD starts failing with a lot of people
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw the limits at 50-100 people.  If most people leave it in
view mode, it gets a little bit better.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there isn&#x27;t much text in it, it&#x27;s better (~10k characters is
low).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the document grew too long: we moved some of the text from
previous episodes to a side-HackMD and linked to it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The failure mode was usually not being able to edit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory, there are no strict limits. With short documents, even 100
or more people could use it. Perhaps this is determined by
length of edit history.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We even saw Google Docs fail with 50 simultaneous editors during
an icebreaker (and our icebreakers with hackmd seemed to work
with ~50).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always have people ask questions and comment at the bottom.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not a &amp;quot;questions section&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lesson section&amp;quot;, always
write at the bottom.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add headings when you get to a new lesson&#x2F;page&#x2F;exercise&#x2F;topic.
Questions go at the bottom, sorted by what you were talking
about at the time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggested heading arrangements (but hackmd master does whatever
makes sense):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for page title&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;##&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for each lesson&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for each episode&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;####&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; for each exercise, group discussion, etc. (if it needs to
be smaller than &lt;code&gt;###&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make participants aware that we plan to publish questions and
answers later as workshop outcomes.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the workshop we add questions and answers from the HackMD
document to the workshop page.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We go through these to make sure that we don&#x27;t publish names or
any sensitive information or any information that would violate
our Code of Conduct.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But even though we take the effort of checking the questions and
answers we recommend to point out to learners and helpers to
only use the form &lt;code&gt;[name=Myname]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; if they prefer to indicate
their name in the notes to simplify discussions during the
workshop.  Before publishing the notes, we remove all of the
&lt;code&gt;[name=Myname]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.  In other words write in a style and recommend
everybody to write in a style which allows us to publish these
notes without hurting anybody&#x27;s privacy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a large workshop, even sharing the notes among other
learners might be too much, and will naturally limit who else
you can share the live notes link with.  Consider if you really
want to ask anyone to put real names in there.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a dedicated host, who focuses on breakout rooms and
registration related matters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a client, not the web browser - though web browser is minimally
OK.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assigning leareners to breakout rooms takes a long time, but luckily
Zoom can make it easy enough:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;pre-assign breakout rooms&amp;quot; seems to only work within one
organization, thus was useless to us&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people name themselves according to the &lt;code&gt;(n) Firstname Lastname&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; system, people sort properly and it becomes very fast
to assign hundreds of people to their rooms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask participants to edit profile beforehand and log into zoom when they join in the
meeting room. This shows the name properly upon entry and thus the zoom host
can confirm that the name is found in the registration list.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is important when you approve entry to the meeting room from the waiting room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling or disabling waiting room is another discussion: For the host, it can be a lot of work verifying people against a
registration list. Plus, we experienced some problems that waiting room interfered breakout room entry (see the point at the bottom of this section). With a private link, waiting room didn&#x27;t seem to be that
important.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare another communication channel dedicated to staff (like
expert helpers and those who could help with HackMD editing), in our
case we used a dedicated topic in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.zulipchat.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CodeRefinery Zulip channel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom chat is sometimes tricky, as it allows communication with
either all to the same room (in the main room or breakout room,
wherever you are, and as a host to all in waiting room) or to an
individual.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HackMD can also be used to discuss among staff, of course always
at the very bottom.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone uses a different computer for Zoom than for doing the
exercises, they can join twice, one of those times for sharing their
screen (second one also be web browser client).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw some interesting Zoom problems:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We experienced in the first
couple of days that after assigning a participant into one
of the breakout rooms, and then that participant leaves from the
meeting room (not only breakout room), and tries to join in the
meeting room again with waiting room enabled, then that
participant was kicked out from the meeting room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&#x27;t still understand the mechanism behind, but once we disabled the
waiting room function (right before opening breakout rooms until
they are closed), it went totally fine.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even after opening breakout rooms, people can join in the
meeting room, and the host could assign the new people into one
of the breakout rooms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-6&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing breakout rooms isn&#x27;t too hard, but do practice.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;streaming&quot;&gt;Streaming&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you reach 100 people in a lesson, you start wondering: why can we
not reach everyone in the world at once?  The technology is there,
it&#x27;s a question of if it matches our vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are worried about trolls in our Zoom meetings, but that is
because the Zoom mechanics is many-to-many, while for a public
meeting you need a one-to-many mechanic where learners can&#x27;t
interact with each other.  Streaming provides this mechanic, at a
loss of interactivity.  In principle, it can co-exist with breakout
rooms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s the point of streaming?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We did streaming in parallel to the interactive workshop.  That
way, anyone who couldn&#x27;t register could also follow along.  They
wouldn&#x27;t get the full experience, but could at least do
something.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We encouraged people to watch streams in groups (ideally with
their own helper) so that they can get the social aspect and
help each other anyway.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can imagine a fully federated system: There is one small Zoom
meeting with instructors doing the teaching.  &lt;em&gt;All&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; learners
join via other Zoom meetings.  Each other Zoom meeting watches
the stream together, and manages their own breakout rooms.  Each
other zoom meeting can communicate to the central one as needed
to adjust the pace, for example chat and hackmd.  HackMD helps
here.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream as an overflow&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had far more people register than we could accommodate, even
after getting as many helpers as we could, we could feel good at
least offering everyone who could not make it a chance to attend
via the stream&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We emphasized that the experience would not be the same, and
they should try to come to another workshop later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stream can also be good for lurkers and passive attendees,
who can&#x27;t go through the effort of attending but would like to
follow along.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with stream viewers&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got questions and comments on the stream chat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also provided a separate streaming HackMD to ask questions.
With our volume, we just as well could have given them the
primary hackmd (and did when someone asked, but we were worried
about trolls)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream viewers seemed pretty happy with what they were getting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks of streaming&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the main room is streamed, people are more cautious about
saying things.  But once we get to 100 participants, the main
room is quiet anyway, so we don&#x27;t lose too much.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of the stream going off-track from what learners need.  You
need a good support system of expert helpers and feedback tools
to keep this working, if it was a stream-only workshop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of learner audio or video being broadcast.  Zoom provides
tools (&amp;quot;spotlight video&amp;quot;) to prevent this, but it doesn&#x27;t work
all the time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra effort needed.  The marginal cost isn&#x27;t that great in the
end, once you know how it works.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom can send a video feed to a streaming service, which
re-broadcasts to the whole world&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has to be enabled under your account, then can be
configured for a particular meeting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Custom streaming server&amp;quot; seems to be able to broadcast to
anything.  In particular, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;coderefinery&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to do our streaming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping learner&#x27;s videos out of the stream&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy of learners is the first prerequisite to streaming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We said: if you speak in the main room, it may be streamed and
recorded.  Your video should never be.  We thought this was
fair, since most main room questions go through hackmd anyway.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakout rooms never recorded or streamed (though some groups
asked if they could be recorded).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom &amp;quot;Spotlight video&amp;quot; means that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that person should go
out into the stream.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The zoom host &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be in the gallery view.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;em&gt;bugs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sometimes and everyone ends up in the stream is
gallery view.  This is extremely frustrating and we didn&#x27;t
find a cause or solution.  Workaround: someone should always
share their screen.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In practice this wasn&#x27;t a big issue, since in the main room
video was off most of the time. We reminded participants to
turn off videos when they are back from breakout room
sessions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We really need to investigate this more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do with the stream while the breakout rooms are going on?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first, during the breakout sessions in the main room, we
spent a lot of time trying to fix problem with people who
couldn&#x27;t be assigned to breakout rooms.  This seems to have been
a waste of time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we decided to not spend time on Zoom problems, and instead
use the main room to do the exercises as a demo.  This was
mainly for the stream viewers, but also could be useful to the
people who couldn&#x27;t join breakout rooms.  In the future, it
could also serve a different type of learning style.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-7&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the place of the workshop in the larger world.  Once you go
big, streaming is not too hard and lets you reach even more people.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do streaming, clearly announce it from the very start, with
the privacy deal (e.g. &amp;quot;video not broadcast, voice may be&amp;quot;).  It is
much harder to add this later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recording&quot;&gt;Recording&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you do streaming, it is a smaller step to recording and posting
the videos.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is benefited by the recordings?  Perhaps not brand new
learners, but the learners who were in the workshop can review
them again later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If recordings require post-processing, they will almost never get
done.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for one-short recording as much as you can: find a way to
keep learners out of the recording so you can go and directly
publish it with the minimum effort afterwards.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A surprising number of learners have asked for the videos after the
workshop.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the videos may not be as useful to someone learning the
material from scratch, they are probably very useful to an
existing learner who wants to review something they already saw,
teach others, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we can&#x27;t provide them quickly, their usefulness is much
reduced.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-8&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly announce the recording privacy statement when first
registering.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make the recording as one-shot as possible, with minimal
post-processing needed.  Plan for who will do this and when already
before the workshop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;ve been to a CodeRefinery workshop, and wonder how these tools are
actually used?  The NordicHPC github organization, which we&#x27;ve
mentioned before, provides a lot of demonstrations on using github and
working collaboratively.  It&#x27;s an example of people who have a common
interest and form a community by using common tools.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, not everything is perfect.  Rather than try to
make everything perfect, they make things good enough, licensed, and
shareable, and improve it as a need comes - possibly, when someone
else has a need and time to improve it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the organization, you can find many examples of using
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;git-intro&#x2F;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (everything),
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;git-collaborative&#x2F;&quot;&gt;pull-request based
workflows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(e.g. sonar, git-pr, slurm2sql), &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;testing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;automated
testing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (e.g. .travis.yml in
sonar, envkernel, nbscript, slurm2sql), &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cicero.xyz&#x2F;v3&#x2F;remark&#x2F;0.14.0&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coderefinery&#x2F;modular-code-development&#x2F;master&#x2F;talk.md&quot;&gt;modular code
development&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

licensing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
(e.g. everything).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you see some examples of NordicHPC tools.  Some tools are useful
to anyone, but some may be more interesting to cluster administrators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;nbscript&quot;&gt;nbscrpt&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an attempt to
provide the familiar script interface to Jupyter notebooks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;sonar&quot;&gt;sonar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;sonar-web&quot;&gt;sonar-web&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide a way to
watch what is actually running on clusters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;git-pr&quot;&gt;git-pr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; saves you keystrokes
when making pull requests, though perhaps
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cli.github.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cli.github.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; takes its place.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;envkernel&quot;&gt;slurm2sql&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; imports the HPC
Slurm job history to a sqlite3 database.  It can be useful, even
individually, to get and analyze data about your jobs.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NordicHPC&#x2F;envkernel&quot;&gt;envkernel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a Jupyter
extension which lets you run your kernels in different environments,
such as Docker, Singularity, and virtual&#x2F;conda environments more
easily.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<title>Announcing the first Nordic-RSE conference</title>
		<published>2020-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/24/nordic-rse-conference/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neic.no&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;04&#x2F;building-a-community&#x2F;&quot;&gt;several CodeRefinery members and their
friends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
started discussing how a Nordic network of Research Software Engineers
(RSEs) could be established, and soon thereafter the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Nordic-RSE
initiative&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; was launched. The idea was to
follow in the footsteps of very successful such initiatives in other
countries, most notably in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rse.ac.uk&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the UK&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nl-rse.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the
Netherlands&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.de-rse.org&#x2F;de&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For the past two years
we have been taking the first steps in this direction. A &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nordic-rse&#x2F;RSE_intro_survey&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;results_nordics_2018_narrative.ipynb&quot;&gt;survey was
conducted&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
to learn about the environment for people in RSE-related
roles. Information on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;map&#x2F;&quot;&gt;groups and people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
working in Nordic universities who identify as RSEs is being
collected, and local campaigns have been launched within several
universities for the creation of new RSE groups. To further grow the
emerging Nordic community of RSEs, we are now happy to announce that
&lt;strong&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;&quot;&gt;first Nordic-RSE conference&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
Nordic-RSE2020, will take place in Stockholm between 1st and 2nd
December 2020&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-conference&quot;&gt;About the conference&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nordic-RSE2020, we will bring together those that develop software
for research purposes and contribute to building the RSE
community. The program is not set in stone but we will have invited
talks, lightning talks, poster sessions and workshops on best
practices for creating research software and other popular RSE related
topics. We expect a large contribution from Nordic RSEs, but will also
invite international RSEs that can help our Nordic community take
shape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis of the conference will be on learning from each other in
a supportive and relaxed atmosphere. The choice of conference venue
for Nordic-RSE2020, the THS student union building at KTH campus in
Stockholm, reflects our hopes: it has lots of spaces for casual
conversations and is equipped with fast internet and all the
facilities required for a successful conference.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-should-attend&quot;&gt;Who should attend?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to reflect the diverse and emerging community of RSEs by
seeking input from all levels of experience and across a variety of
domains, genders, and ethnicities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome participation from:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research
purposes;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software developers working in a research context, whatever their
job title or field;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use
existing research software (e.g. with respect to scalability,
performance and&#x2F;or reproducibility);&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People from any organization providing tools, platforms or services
that benefit research software;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with a stake in research software (funders, publishers,
decision makers, etc).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We especially encourage first-time presenters and can offer mentoring
and other support with preparing your contribution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-involved&quot;&gt;Getting involved&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make this a successful conference, we will need help from
volunteers to ensure that all the logistics and practicalities work
smoothly. What&#x27;s in it for you? All conference helpers get a free
conference ticket! Please get in touch with the organizing committee
(nordic-rse-organizers@neic.no) if you would like to help or if you
have any questions on how to get involved with Nordic-RSE2020.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also need sponsors to cover costs, keep the conference fee as
low as possible and to be able to offer travel grants to younger
participants. We have already received generous offers for sponsorship
from the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e-science.se&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Swedish e-Science Research Centre
(SeRC)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snic.se&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Swedish National Infrastructure
for Computing (SNIC)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;essenceofescience.se&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Swedish e-science
collaboration (eSSENCE)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. By supporting
us, our sponsors are helping to raise awareness of the importance of
developing RSE career path in the Nordics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;inviting-new-sponsors&quot;&gt;Inviting new sponsors&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nordic-RSE2020 is the first networking and community-building event of
Nordic-RSE. We will meet to network, to learn about best software
practices, reproducible research and open science, and to further
develop communication and project management skills required by RSEs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSEs are the connection between technology and research. If you want
to get a message directly to those who facilitate research with
technology, you want to sponsor this conference. Our attendees often
shape decisions about tools, contracts and approaches to research
software and computing – either directly or through their role in
advising, training and collaborating with researchers. In addition to
the chance to raise awareness of how your products or services are
relevant to modern research, sponsors will get mentions, visibility,
and depending on the sponsor package chosen, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;sponsorship&#x2F;#sponsor-packages&quot;&gt;conference tickets and
contributed workshops, posters or short
talks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For
information on sponsorship see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nordic-rse.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;sponsorship&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/24/online-workshops-update/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After cancelling all our planned in-person workshops this spring due
to the ongoing pandemic, we decided to make the best of the situation
and start focusing our efforts on developing an online workshop
training programme. We wanted to start small while learning the
mechanics of online teaching, so we began by offering an online
workshop covering only the
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;git-intro&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Git-intro&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; lesson to a
group of around 25 participants on April 7-8. Neither teaching nor
attending online workshops offers quite the same experience as
attending in-person events, but we were pleasantly surprised about how
well the workshop went and it definitely gave a boost to our ambitions
to move more of our traditional workshops online. Online workshops will
also provide a means for us to &lt;em&gt;scale up&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and reach a larger audience
than possible with in-person workshops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned many important lessons in this first experiment and we
tried to summarize them all in a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;first-online-workshop&#x2F;&quot;&gt;previous
article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We
hope that these notes can be of help to others who are going online
with some of their teaching.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-notify-me-form&quot;&gt;New notify-me form&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to be delivering many more online workshops also after
covid-19 restrictions are lifted and life starts returning to
normal. We realized that this means that our old notify-me form has
become obsolete - it is no longer enough to only indicate the
city in which you want to attend a workshop. So we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;upcoming&#x2F;#notify-me&quot;&gt;new more
fine-grained notify-me
form&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where
people can sign up for updates about upcoming online and&#x2F;or in-person
workshops and also indicate which lessons they are most interested
in. If you want to be informed of upcoming workshops, please sign
up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;join-an-online-workshops-as-a-helper&quot;&gt;Join an online workshops as a helper&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new notify-me form now also has an option to indicate that you are
interested in participating as a helper or instructor.  Instructors
always need help and this is even more relevant for our online
workshops. Helpers assist learners in overcoming technical problems
and work through challenges or questions they may have. Ideally, we
need at least one helper per breakout room (4-5 learners). Helpers
don&#x27;t have to be familiar with all the lesson material - experience
with even just one lesson&#x2F;tool&#x2F;approach is sufficient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you already particated in one or more workshops, and now want to
help us in spreading better software development practices to the world?
Register as &lt;strong&gt;helper&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for upcoming online or in-person workshops in our
new &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;upcoming&#x2F;#notify-me&quot;&gt;notify-me
form&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Remember
also that there is no better way to consolidate new knowledge than
teaching it to others!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bring-your-own-breakout-room-helper&quot;&gt;Bring your own breakout room&#x2F;helper&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With online courses over video we could in principle aim at reaching a
larger scale than in-person workshops which are limited by room-size
and being visible and audible, but also by the number of helpers. In
online workshops the presence of helpers is no less important to make
sure that each breakout room has a helper to answer questions during
exercise sessions. We are considering to offer participants the
possibility to &amp;quot;bring their own breakout room&amp;quot; to the workshop. This
way they can collaborate on exercises with colleagues they already
know, if they prefer so. More importantly, they can assign one person
who is more experienced in the toolset presented to take the role as
helper. Participating as helper not only means &amp;quot;giving&amp;quot; but is also a
great learning experience: both in the tools and in solving problems
and supporting and teaching other learners.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;upcoming-online-workshops&quot;&gt;Upcoming online workshops&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to arrange two full online CodeRefinery workshops covering all
our material before the summer. The format will be to split the
workshop content over six half-days spread over two weeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May we will do our first full CodeRefinery workshop, starting on a
Tuesday, and ending on a Thursday the week after. Drawing on the
experience from this first full workshop, the plan is to deliver a
second online workshop in June.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;upcoming&#x2F;#notify-me&quot;&gt;notify-me
form&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; if you
want to receive an email as soon as registration opens for these
workshoops!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Rebase vs merge</title>
		<published>2020-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/24/rebase-vs-merge/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/24/rebase-vs-merge/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During a CodeRefinery workshop you might have heard an instructor say
that you can merge or alternatively rebase, like merge and rebase are
two equivalent operations. Clearly, they are not, but should we treat
the operations equally?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take a closer look at rebase and merge, how they differ  and in
which situations they are an advantage to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebase&quot;&gt;Rebase&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebase gives you the opportunity to move the base of a branch to a new
base. Here we have two branches, &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;feature_A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Initial tree&quot; title=&quot;Initial git commit tree&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rebase the &lt;code&gt;feature_A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch to the last commit in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; checkout feature_A
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; rebase master
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result will look like this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;First rebase tree&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree
after rebase&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking out &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; again, we can merge &lt;code&gt;feature_A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The merge will by default be a fast-forward. We end up with a linear history, which many find attractive as it is easy to follow. The disadvantage is that we rewrite the history as the commit hashes changes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_03.png&quot; alt=&quot;FF-merge tree&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree after fast-forward merge&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;merge&quot;&gt;Merge&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t use rebase, but just merge &lt;code&gt;feature_A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we get an merge commit, a new commit pointing  to the previous last commit in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and the previous last commit in &lt;code&gt;feature_A&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_04.png&quot; alt=&quot;Plain merge tree&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree after regular merge&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we only do merges, we show the true story of the repository, how the code came to be. As the repository grows with new branches, maybe more contributors, following the history can become very challenging. The git graph can look like the tracks of a large railway station, where it can be hard to find the ancestors of a feature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mixing-rebase-and-merge&quot;&gt;Mixing rebase and merge&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sticking to either rebase or merge, we could use both operations, but establish principles for when we will use merge and under which conditions we use rebase:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we merge a semantic unit to &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we use merge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When patch features, or do general corrections, we use rebase.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will this look?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;merge-revisited&quot;&gt;Merge revisited&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us say we have created a new function or class, something that belongs together - a semantic unit we call &lt;code&gt;feature_B&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The base of &lt;code&gt;feature_B&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the last commit in &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_05.png&quot; alt=&quot;Master feature-b tree&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree with master and a new feature&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:70%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we do a merge, git will by default do a fast-forward merge. Following our newly stated policy, we want this merge to be a merge commit. Consequently, we add the option --no-ff to the merge command:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; checkout master
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; merge feature_B&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt; --no-ff
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, we can configure git to default do merge commits, by setting the configuration to not do fast-forward by default. Here as a global setting, spanning all our projects:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; config&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt; --global&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; branch.master.mergeoptions&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt; --no-ff
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result will be like this, where the feature is clearly visible in a feature path, presumably with well written commit messages explaining what has been added in this path of work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_06.png&quot; alt=&quot;No-ff merge tree&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree after --no-ff merge&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebase-revisited&quot;&gt;Rebase revisited&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we  take the case where we checkout a branch from C1 to do some corrections. While we were doing the corrections, at least before we were able to complete the corrections, &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; moved to M1 as in the picture above. A merge commit will add unnecessary complexity to the story of our project. We are not adding a new semantic unit, just fixing things that got wrong in the first phase. That we started to fix things from C1 is not necessarily a important information to keep for the project.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_07.png&quot; alt=&quot;No-ff merge tree plus patch&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree with a merged feature branch and a patch branch in master&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our second principle, we rebase the fix_typos branch to M1. Then we do a merge, but this time as fast-forward. If we have configured merge for not doing fast forward when possible, as the configuration statement above, we need to add the --ff-only argument:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; checkout fix_types
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; rebase master
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; checkout master
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; merge fix_typos&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#5597d6;&quot;&gt; --ff-only
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The git graph will now look like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;blog&#x2F;image_08.png&quot; alt=&quot;No-ff merge plus rebase&quot; title=&quot;git commit tree with a merged feature branch and a rebased patch branch&quot; &#x2F;&gt;{:class=&amp;quot;img-responsive&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;max-width:100%&amp;quot;}&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebase-vs-merge-revisited&quot;&gt;Rebase vs merge revisited&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebase and merge serve two different purposes. We can use this to our advantage to create a clear story, a more readable git log (It is important to create a story, remember?). By using the above principles as guidance, we will become more conscious of where these operations will serve us or add more clutter. For instance, we might conclude that rebasing semantic branches, but insisting on a merge commit, is perfectly fine, because it is where the feature (the semantic entity) enters the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; branch which is important, not where the development first started. Features will clearly stand out as a visible pattern in a git repository following such a practice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CodeRefinery is a project that holds workshops, but computing is an
experience.  As much as we teach in workshops, it&#x27;s not enough: these
workshops are hands-on, but still can&#x27;t show our whole daily thought
process. They also aren&#x27;t the right format for everyone and can&#x27;t
reach enough people at once.  In order to extend our reach, we are
trying a streaming web show &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchsoftwarehour.github.io&quot;&gt;Research Software Hour&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that combines
the spirit of CodeRefinery with real-life examples from our daily
work - and hopefully, some entertainment, too. We hope watchers
experience the &lt;em&gt;spirit of research software and computing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that there had to be a way to reach more people, so considered
streaming and decided to do it together: it&#x27;s more fun and more
engaging for the audience, we can discuss, ask each other questions,
show each other new tools we discovered, learn from each other,
hopefully teach the audience some.  We will certainly be learning a
lot from the audience, too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish to show why we enjoy research software and computing and how
you can, too.  &lt;strong&gt;This is an interactive show, and a big part is
answering your questions.  We encourage you to submit your own codes
and scripts and repositories which we can constructively review on
stream.  You&#x27;ll get positive ideas and everyone will benefit.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; We are
not experts in everything and will also show you the errors we make
and how we get through them and also critically review our own codes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are starting this as a two-person project (Richard Darst from Aalto
University, Finland, and Radovan Bast from UiT the Arctic University
of Norway, both working as part of the CodeRefinery project).  This is
an open source production - anyone can help us develop Research
Software Hour, too.  There are many different ways to contribute, from
streaming to developing material to community building.  Join us with
questions, answers, ideas, code!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;researchsoftwarehour.github.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and join us each Tuesday at 20:30 CEST on Twitch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Lessons learned from running our first online workshop</title>

		<id>https://coderefinery.org/blog/2020/04/14/first-online-workshop/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;April 7-8, 2020, we gave our first online workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.github.io&#x2F;2020-04-07-online&#x2F;&quot;&gt;introduction to
Git&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (2 x 3 hours) with 22
participants and we plan to deliver many more such workshops on a number of
topics based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coderefinery.org&#x2F;lessons&#x2F;&quot;&gt;lessons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop went well. Online feels slower, but has a different set of
advantages (we discussed later whether we actually covered significantly less
than during an in-person workshop and we were not sure the pace was actually
slower).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we wish to share with the community our lessons learned: What worked well
and what we need and plan to improve. We use bullet point format for brevity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s maybe obvious but aiming for less material at a calm pace is better than
trying to cover all material too fast. During the online workshop we will
manage to traverse less material than in-person and it&#x27;s good to prepare for
that. For 1 hour session, plan for 30 minutes. The rest will be questions,
issues, and breaks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;breaks-and-ice-breaker&quot;&gt;Breaks and ice-breaker&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minute breaks were too short, better 10 minutes or longer, at least once an
hour.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have started with a demonstration of the tools (Zoom and HackMD) and this
was probably time well spent (thanks to Greg Wilson&#x27;s excellent
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.rstudio.com&#x2F;webinars&#x2F;teaching-online-at-short-notice&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
and references therein).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The HackMD ice-breaker was for each participant to write their name,
operating system, experience with Git, and optionally what they are working
on. We found it useful to pre-fill the HackMD section with the participants&#x27;
initials to avoid that all cursors start from the same place and everybody
hesitates to write something.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We should have included a &amp;quot;ice-breaker&amp;quot; break-out room session where persons can talk
about something informally considering that the first time participants
possibly ever experience a breakout room is in the first exercise (they may not
know how breakout rooms work, they need to find the exercise in the material,
they don&#x27;t know anybody). We want people to feel comfortable and to ask
questions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-technical-issues&quot;&gt;Solving technical issues&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online, the initial problems can end up derailing the whole day&#x27;s schedule, and
take longer to get resolved. Compensate by ensuring they are set up in advance,
which is also easier to do online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On day 1 we spent some time debugging tech issues and for the next event we
plan to create a 5-10 minute video &amp;quot;setting up and configuring Git&amp;quot; and ask
all participants to show up at a session one day before the workshop to
demonstrate that all is set up to not lose any time during the actual workshop.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For solving technical problems we found it useful to move the participant
into a breakout room with a helper where the participant can share screen and
this way we could solve problems without disrupting the main flow too much.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, if one has previously created groups for group work, the only way
to send helper-instructor pair to room is to delete all the existing rooms
or un-assign all participants. It&#x27;s not possible to launch just a single room
out of several existing rooms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We think that when pre-making the rooms, you have to create some empty
spares for this.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;helpers&quot;&gt;Helpers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without limitations on distance, we can involve more helpers. With more use of
breakout rooms, they have a more clear job and it could be a great opportunity
to pay forward but also learn more for someone who finished CodeRefinery a
little while ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep a high quality of the workshop each group should have one
helper&#x2F;instructor. But this places limits on scalability - we can&#x27;t have too
many participants and must maintain a 1:5 helper:participant ratio.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers were important for our breakout room systems to work. They don&#x27;t have
to be the absolute experts: primary instructors can rotate between breakout
rooms and help with hard questions, also having typically more experience with the material
and exercise goals.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers can be recruited from previous online workshops, and perhaps that
could even be a requirement: &amp;quot;price of workshop is to attend a later workshop
as helper&amp;quot; (not a direct lesson learned from this workshop).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;breakout-sessions&quot;&gt;Breakout sessions&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakout rooms are pretty good, but as a host, the Zoom mechanics take some
getting used to. We found an interesting semi-flipped classroom mechanic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer longer (15 min) breakout sessions were better than many short ones
(5-10 min).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This also means that we should group some exercises and not have them spread
out every 10 minutes.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On day 1 we tried to group participants according to operating systems but we
got better feedback and it felt better after grouping participants either
randomly or even better according to experience.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups with 4-5 persons seem to work well, with one helper.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In breakout rooms encourage participants to share their screen and other
participants to comment but also make sure that it&#x27;s not only one participant
sharing all the time at every group session.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some exercises can be done in driver-navigator mode, where one participant
who shares screen types in the commands and other participants in the room
discuss and recommend what to type.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people just wanted to work alone, that&#x27;s OK too.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1: group work&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most teaching done in main room (this is important for the most important
and delicate topics).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants are in breakout rooms, working independently, sharing
screen&#x2F;asking for help when they need to.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2: flipped classroom&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (&amp;quot;flipped classroom&amp;quot; isn&#x27;t quite the right
term though)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial motivation in the main room.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to breakout rooms early to go through the type-along exercises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This only works when things are clear enough that people can&#x27;t get too lost.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(*) One learner shares screen, others follow along discussing, asking
question, and typing along themselves.  Emphasize &amp;quot;it&#x27;s easiest to share
the screen since you don&#x27;t have to do the thinking&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(*) Instructor flips between the rooms every 1-2 minutes answering hard
questions and following progress.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join the end for a wrap-up where best questions are discussed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helpers and instructors should write down the most important questions to
discuss afterwards.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In reality, use the best of both depending on your specific lesson,
especially the asterisk (*) points!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage the instructor to cycle through breakout rooms to watch
discussions and help out.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many interesting questions were asked in breakout rooms but we did not
write them down, they could have been interesting for everybody.  They
should be written down and discussed as a follow-up in method (2).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host can lose host rights sometimes.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host should not enter breakout rooms, at least if they are not the original
host because then hostship is transferred to original host.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our case the person who created the meeting room transferred hostship to
another instructor who then organized the breakout room but we experienced
a technical glitch and hostship fell back to the first person and we lost the
room assignments and for a minute or two the room creator did not even notice
this (was busy helping out a participant). This means that ideally the person
who is the main host should also create the meeting room, if possible.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard: at least when I was main host in another meeting, I could join a
breakout room and not lose host. I think. Needs more testing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-hosts seem to be able to jump between rooms freely &lt;em&gt;after&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; first joining
the room they were originally assigned to (i.e. can&#x27;t select any group from
the main room).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point, Zoom dropped the whole meeting and everyone re-joined
(automatically).  Pre-assembled breakout rooms got lost, which was annoying.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hackmd&quot;&gt;HackMD&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HackMD was a vital resource&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, but you should have someone dedicated to watching it and keeping it organized.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were impressed how well it worked, holding up with 25 persons editing
without noticeable lag.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a question was too advanced or we had no time to answer it, we encouraged
to write the question in HackMD (or wrote it ourselves there) so that it
could be answered later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking and replying question in HackMD worked well. It worked so well that
even in physical workshops we should use HackMD for questions that helpers
can answer!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives the possibility to answer at different levels of complexity in
successive bullets, so that each participant can read until satisfied with
the answer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students can come back after the course and find better researched answers,
if the in-course answer is unsatisfactory.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the HackMD contents, without any identifying information, can
be made public after the course.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of asking questions in a particular section of the HackMD and
searching and scrolling it was better to ask questions &lt;em&gt;always at the current
bottom&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the document.  Add new section headings as you start new sections.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some questions on HackMD were a bit off topic (but still very good questions)
and some answers probably looked confusing so some questions can be postponed
for after the video call and answered later.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants should be asked to give feedback after each day at the end of
the HackMD. One positive experience, one thing to improve, as usual.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chat window in the Zoom client is useful because it can provide multiple
ways to get information for different learning styles. However, it is not
threaded and you have to keep it from getting out of hand. Better for detailed
questions to go into HackMD.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helped to direct most questions and answers to HackMD and only short
administrative questions via chat. Participants should not be asked to watch
both the chat and the document.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The chat can be used for formative assessment questions where participants
are asked to vote for correct answers in a multiple-choice question.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical announcements&#x2F;instructions should be provided both written and
spoken, to reduce chance they are missed.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recommended signals (raise hand, \hand, red&#x2F;yellow &amp;quot;sticky&amp;quot; notes) should
not only be communicated at the beginning but also written somewhere and
easily findable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;organization&quot;&gt;Organization&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online, there are more things to think about, but also more ways to communicate
(they go together). To compensate, have enough people and clear roles about who
does what.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We used a private chat as back-channel to coordinate among instructors and
helpers. We kept the chat private to not reveal any personal information we
may need to share but we noticed later that most&#x2F;all of what we talked about
could have been and &lt;em&gt;should have been&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; public (though not necessarily to
students, but just for reasons of cognitive load). We never needed names and
the only sensitive information were room connection details.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On day 1 we failed&#x2F;forgot to assign clear roles to ourselves; we were all a
bit overwhelmed with the chat, plus the HackMD, plus answering questions on
the microphone, plus some of us preparing and giving the lectures. Next time we
will try:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles during main lectures:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host person in charge of overall schedule, timekeeping, breakout rooms and
Zoom chat&#x2F;participant reactions, clearing feedback, balancing answering
questions, moderating, etc.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructor and upcoming instructors (they can&#x27;t at the same time prepare
their material, follow questions, and do one of the other jobs). One of our
instructors managed to do both: teach and manage breakout rooms, so it is
possible, but easier if somebody else takes the charge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One person watching and formatting the HackMD (but more persons might be
needed if there are many questions).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup expert helpers for problems that require intensive debugging (at
least needed at the beginning).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles during breakouts (this is more flexible):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host in main room watching stuff.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One helper per room leading.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson instructor hopping from room to room answering advanced questions
and also probing the general mood.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host makes all instructors and helpers co-hosts so that they can move between
rooms.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;screencasting&quot;&gt;Screencasting&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements and recommendations are roughly like in-person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing history of commands via tmux or similar, coupled with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coderefinery&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;presenting.md#screencasting&quot;&gt;displaying the
last commands
typed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
really helps.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gray&#x2F;dark background terminal looked better than light background terminal.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-this-more-scalable&quot;&gt;How to make this more scalable?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time we did not plan to record or stream but we nevertheless asked the
participants in a pre-workshop survey: 2&#x2F;20 preferred not to have the
workshop streamed, 1&#x2F;20 didn&#x27;t want it recorded.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The workshop was great, but we should think more about how to reach more
people.  A small workshop where we can individually interact with everyone is
amazing, but the promise of digital technology is that we can reach everyone in
the world.  How can we get the best of both?  Can we also do something for
everyone else who can&#x27;t attend but might want to watch later?  This is
something to think about.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we make this more scalable?  This workshop was quite labor-intensive.
You could probably do it with two instructors (instructor + HackMD watcher) + 1
zoom expert (host + general helper) + a lot of semi-experienced helpers (1:5
ratio) + a few debuggers to help with tech support the first hour (not
overlapping with instructor or HackMD watcher).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine if we had main room recorded (or even streamed), but breakout rooms
not.  People can still ask and interact with privacy in the small rooms - and
we take these comments&#x2F;issues back to the main room.  Other people following
along later can do the exercises at their own pace, and hear the
intros&#x2F;conclusions in the main rooms, and it might feel a bit like a small
class.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
