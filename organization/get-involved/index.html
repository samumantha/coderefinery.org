    <p>CodeRefinery has two main activities: </p>
<ul>
<li>maintain and further develop the CodeRefinery <strong>open source project</strong> to produce lesson material openly and collaboratively;</li>
<li>deliver trainings, mainly by workshops with hands-on exercises and type-along sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are in the same galaxy as the <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries organization</a> and closely work with them. 
We run our workshops in a slightly different way, but our general philosophy, lesson
material, and procedures are very similar. 
Our target audience is learners who already have some experience with programming and would like to develop software in a more efficient and sustainable way. </p>
<p>Anyone may contribute to the CodeRefinery open source project. </p>
<p>From 2016-10-01 to 2021-10-31, CodeRefinery received funding from <a href="https://neic.no/">NeIC</a> and delivered a large number of face to face and online workshops to the Nordic Community.  After that point, we are a community project seeking volunteers to sustain what we have accomplished in the first five years.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery is always looking for both people and institutions that can
promote the FAIRness of software management and development practice. There are
many ways that you can get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are a learner, helper or instructor, you can check out our
<a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/">manuals</a>, in particular the <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/the-project/">about
us</a> and
<a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/">contributing</a> pages, for
more about us.</li>
<li>if you are an institution, a research group or a company, you can check out our <a href="https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/">Training hubs</a> section to learn how to support us and become a Member organization.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="host-a-workshop">Host a workshop</h3>
<p>There are different ways to organize and deliver workshops using partly or entirely our training material. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request the support of the CodeRefinery Team to organize a CodeRefinery workshop;</li>
<li>Register a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop;</li>
<li>Register a self-organized workshop using CodeRefinery lessons.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost depends on the type of workshop and the membership tier your institution has subscribed. For more information, check our <a href="https://coderefinery.org/about/hubs/">Training Hubs</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="coderefinery-workshops-with-support-of-the-coderefinery-team">CodeRefinery workshops with support of the CodeRefinery Team</h4>
<h4 id="self-organized-coderefinery-workshop">Self-organized CodeRefinery workshop</h4>
<p>In the sections below, we provide you with more detailed information on each CodeRefinery or Carpentries type of self-organized workshop.</p>
<h5 id="self-organized-carpentries-workshop">Self-organized Carpentries workshop</h5>
<p>The requirements for a self-organized Carpentries workshop can be found <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core">here</a> on the Carpentries website.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no administrative fee</strong> to run a self-organized Carpentries workshop. </p>
<p>To add your Carpentries workshop in the list of upcoming workshops in the <a href="https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/">CodeRefinery's &quot;upcoming workshops&quot; page</a>, get in touch with us on <a href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com">https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com</a> in #request-workshops stream. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/">the registration form submitted to the Carpentries</a>, there is a question asking you if you wish to publish your workshop in <a href="https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/">the Carpentries upcoming workshops</a> (and if applicable, each Carpentry's upcoming workshops for Software, Data or Library Carpentry). </p>
<h5 id="self-organized-coderefinery-workshop-1">Self-organized CodeRefinery workshop</h5>
<p>The requirements for a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach at least three CodeRefinery lessons (we recommend one from the section <strong>For yourself and larger</strong>, one from <strong>For your group and larger</strong> and one from <strong>For the community</strong>);</li>
<li>Have at least one certified Carpentry or CodeRefinery instructor;</li>
<li>Use CodeRefinery surveys to get evaluations and to help us collect feedback from the learners;</li>
<li>Abide by <a href="https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/">CodeRefinery's Code of Conduct</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is <strong>no administrative fee</strong> to run a self-organized CodeRefinery workshop. </p>
<p>If your workshop fulfill the requirements detailed above, it can be listed as a &quot;self-organized CodeRefinery workshop&quot; on our website at <a href="https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/">Workshops/events</a> under <strong>self-organized CodeRefinery workshops</strong>. Please get in touch with us on  <a href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com">https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com</a> in #request-workshops stream to add it on our website.</p>
<h4 id="self-organized-workshop-or-any-training-activity-using-coderefinery-lessons">Self-organized workshop or any training activity using CodeRefinery lessons</h4>
<p>All CodeRefinery and The Carpentries training material are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>, so you can teach this material yourself and mix and match with any other material.</p>
<p>However, we would love to know when CodeRefinery lesson material is used for any type of training, including workshops, credited/non-credited courses, or other types of learning events! Please let us know on <a href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com">https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com</a> in #request-workshops stream, as well as whether or not you wish your event to be listed in our website, under <strong>self-organized workshops or training activities using CodeRefinery lesson material</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="become-a-workshop-helper">Become a workshop helper</h3>
<p>Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! <a href="/get-involved/#contact-us">Get in
touch</a> and let us know which workshop you would like
to join. For more information about what a helper is supposed to do, please
refer <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/">Helper’s
guide</a></p>
<h3 id="become-an-instructor">Become an instructor</h3>
<p>There is no requirement for using our training material. However, 
we suggest that most instructors start with <a href="https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/">Carpentries instructor
training</a>. We have <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor
training</a>, but
this mostly serves as a complement focused on our lessons and more
intermediate users.</p>
<p>After taking either instructor training, you are welcome to
self-organize a CodeRefinery workshop or join a workshop as an
instructor when instructors are recruited via #workshop stream of
<a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/">CodeRefinery Zulip
chat</a>.</p>
<p>With that being said, there are no strict requirements to working with
us and learning &quot;on the job&quot;: we help people organically grow from
learner → helper → instructor.  So far, the best way to get involved is to
join our chat and let us know when you see something you are
interested in.</p>
<h3 id="contribute-to-teaching-material">Contribute to teaching material</h3>
<p>All our <a href="/lessons/">lessons</a> are <a href="https://github.com/coderefinery">on GitHub</a>. Contributions
to the lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via
the forking-pull request workflow. See our lesson on <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/">collaborative version
control</a> for
an overview of how this works. You can also <a href="/get-involved/#contact-us">contact us</a> via other
channels.</p>
<h3 id="reuse-our-material">Reuse our material</h3>
<p>We very much encourage reusing our lessons and contributing changes:
