    <p><strong>Update, 12th October 2021</strong></p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the continuation of the project and to keep it possible to issue
certificates, we will keep the workshop/hackathon/training participants'
data from 2020 and 2021 until December 2024.</li>
<li>When we know which newsletter/notify-me platform to use in the new project
phase (hopefully by early next year), we will notify the current
newsletter/notify-me subscribers to subscribe to a new platform and
unsubscribe all of them from the current ones after the notification email
is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the 1st October 2021, it was announced that CodeRefinery will receive
partial financial support by NeIC for the next 3 years (CodeRefinery
Sustainability Phase, CodeRefinery SP, see
<a href="https://neic.no/news/2021/10/01/2021-open-call-results/">https://neic.no/news/2021/10/01/2021-open-call-results/</a>). The next phase of
the CodeRefinery project is mainly consisting of in-kind contributions by
diverse partner organizations. In this new phase, we need to renew our privacy
policy, but we need some time before the new privacy policy is set.</p>
<p>We will continue using our online community spaces and the current
owners/administrators will remain until new roles are set in the CodeRefinery
SP.</p>
<p>Previously we have written that &quot;Stored names and email addresses of users
will be removed with the end of this project (2021-10-31)&quot;.  However, we need
to keep participation data from 2020 and 2021 workshops at least until the end
of 2022 since we often get asked for participation certificates long after the
workshop is concluded.  Therefore, we will keep information of the
participants who are qualified to certificates (either as learner, helper,
expert helper, or exercise lead) in the currently used platform, Indico,
managed by NeIC. The currently participating staff who is also committed to be
a part of the CodeRefinery SP have access to the information.</p>
<p>We continue using the newsletter and notify-me form also in the new phase but
we may switch to other services but in this case we would notify all
subscribers about deletion of their contact information and invite them to
re-register to the new services that we may migrate to.  If a user wants to
unsubscribe before that, they are welcome to do so anytime.</p>
